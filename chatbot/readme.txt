How It Works:
The chatbot uses if-else statements to match the user input against predefined rules.
The input is converted to lowercase to make the chatbot case-insensitive.
The chatbot can respond to greetings, questions about the time, date, and its name.
If the input doesn't match any of the predefined rules, the chatbot gives a default response.
Running the Code:
When you run this code, the chatbot will start a conversation with you in the terminal.
You can type various inputs to see how the chatbot responds.
Type "exit" to end the conversation.
